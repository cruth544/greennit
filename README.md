Greenit is a media sharing platform that reduces the amount of paths that need to be taken to view the media. The intent is to make browsing and viewing easier for the user and require minimal effort.

Greenit uses Ruby on Rails to interact with a PostgreSQL database that stores URL links on Post and Comment models.
Greenit has 4 models, a User, Subgreenit, Post, and Comment.

A couple things could be improved, such as endless scrolling and better website link support (vs images/gifs/videos).
